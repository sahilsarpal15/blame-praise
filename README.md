# Blame/Praise App

`Disclaimer: It is a waste of time.`czxc

A silly app that I wrote while sipping a glass of coke. It's nothing really!

## Things I learned through the app:

  - Yeoman
  - Grunt
  - Bower
  - Angular JS
  - A new kind of UI (Console-based)

In short, ***awesome*** front-end workflow.

## Demo

I guess, some of you will be nerd enough to see what really this app does. Head over to [http://mohitmamoria.com/fun/blame-praise](http://mohitmamoria.com/fun/blame-praise) to see it in action.

*Don't complain that I didn't warn you before about it being a waste of time*

## FAQ

  - ### Why this app?
To try out a few new things on a lazy afternoon. Afterall, as Leonardo Da Vinci said, "Learning is the only thing the mind never exhausts, never fears and never exhausts." (Or as our own Mr Big B says, "*Seekhna band toh jeetna band!*")

  - ### Okay, but why a Github repo for this waste-of-time app?
Show me a nerd who doesn't love whatever he creates. Even if it is a waste-of-time app. I love it and a dedicated Github repo is a proof of it. `;)`

  - ### Okay *baba*, but why these FAQs?
If you are reading this answer, then you must me somewhat interested in what I am writing. And keeping you interested is the sole purpose of these questions. I bet, you want more questions in this FAQ section. `:p` (Also, it is make me learn Markdown, that I trying to run away from for last couple of months.)

  - ### What now?
Nothing. If you want, play a little with the app [here](http://mohitmamoria.com/fun/blame-praise). Or go back to what you're doing before coming here.

  - ### Can you please tell a joke too (as a token of appreciation for going through this shit!)?
Yes.

  - ### What "yes"? Tell.
Here you go:
```
    A Roman walks into a bar, puts up two fingers and says, "I'll have five beers please."
```

  - ### What the hell!
But this was the best one, I ever told. `:/` I thought you knew Roman numbers.

  - ### F*#k off! Let me go.
Sure. Sayonara. `:)`
